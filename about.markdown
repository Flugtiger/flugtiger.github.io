Hi there, I'm Alex and I welcome you to my little space on the internet that you somehow found your way to.

I'm passionate about software since I got the programmable calculator of my older sister between my fingers when I was 12 years old.
Now, one university diploma (in information systems technology) and some years of experience as a professional software developer and architect later, I feel ready to share some of my thoughts here.
Maybe someone finds it useful (even if it'll be just my future self).

Currently I'm employed at the second biggest online store in germany - otto.de - where I'm part of the team that is working on the management of customer benefits.
Before that, I worked at a local automotive software and service company where we developed a web application for the management of automotive software test results.

Besides software, my passion for technology stretches out to means of transportation that don't need extra energy to work (at least for the greatest part).
So it comes that I own a sailplane pilot license and a license for sailing yachts (and prefer to go by bike).
What I especially like about sailing (in the air and at sea) is the need to become aligned with the forces of nature in order to get to your destination in a safe way.
In order to do so, one has to learn a lot about nature and physics which I enjoy a lot.
